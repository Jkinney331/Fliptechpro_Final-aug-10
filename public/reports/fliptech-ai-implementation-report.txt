ROI CALCULATION FRAMEWORK
=========================

Key ROI Metrics:
- Cost Savings: Reduced operational costs through automation
- Revenue Increase: Enhanced customer experience and sales
- Efficiency Gains: Improved productivity and time savings
- Risk Reduction: Minimized errors and compliance issues

ROI Calculation Formula:
ROI = ((Gains - Investment) / Investment) × 100

Sample ROI Calculation:
- Initial Investment: $50,000 (AI implementation)
- Annual Savings: $120,000 (automation + efficiency)
- Revenue Increase: $80,000 (improved customer experience)
- Total Annual Gains: $200,000
- ROI: ((200,000 - 50,000) / 50,000) × 100 = 300%
