# AI Agent Teams

Understanding how our AI departments work together.

## Understanding AI Departments

AI Agent Teams aren't just multiple agents—they're coordinated departments where each specialist has a role, shares context, and contributes to collective intelligence.

### What Makes a Department

Unlike standalone AI agents that handle single tasks, our departments:
- Work collaboratively on complex workflows
- Share knowledge and context between team members
- Make decisions based on collective intelligence
- Scale operations without adding headcount

## Department Architecture

Each department consists of:

### Lead Agent
Coordinates team activities and strategic decisions

### Specialist Agents
Handle specific tasks within the department

### Knowledge Base
Shared context and learning

### Workflow Engine
Orchestrates multi-step processes

### Quality Assurance
Validates outputs before delivery
